Dear Moving Walls applicant,

Thank you for your interest in Moving Walls. This email confirms the successful completion of your application. You need not take any further steps.

Please note that we receive a high number of submissions each year. We look closely at each portfolio, and so our review process takes several months. You should be hearing from us sometime in June 2014 with a response. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you in advance for your patience as we consider your application.

Warm regards,

Documentary Photography Project, Open Society Foundations
