Dear Moving Walls photographer,

Thank you for your interest in Moving Walls. This email confirms the successful completion of your application. You need not take any further steps.

Please note that we receive a high number of submissions each year. We look closely at each portfolio, and so our review process may take several months. You should be hearing from us sometime in May 2013. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you in advance for your patience.

Warm regards,

Documentary Photography Project, Open Society Foundations
